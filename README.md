## 🚨 Customer Churn Prediction System

### 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Customer Churn Prediction System** using machine learning techniques.  
The objective is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service and present actionable insights through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.

---

### 🧠 Problem Statement
Customer retention is critical for businesses, as acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.  
This project uses classification-based machine learning models to predict churn probability and segment customers based on risk levels, enabling proactive retention strategies.
